Traitar uses __[support vector machines (SVMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)__, which are a class of algorithms using linear N-dimensional hyperplanes based on supervised training. They can also use a [kernel function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method) or "data transformation" to be turned into non-linear methods.
